Write a C class that can be used to transform a mathematical expression from infix notation to Reverse Polish notation Test your class by writing a RPN Calculator 
Suppose we wanted to convert a mathematical expression into a reverse polish notation expression to evaluate the answer This is called an infix expression To convert it (to be able to evaluate the expression as well), we will use shunting yard algorithm This algorithm is stack based and also includes an output list The stack
